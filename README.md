# Data Science Project: Clustering Analysis of Wholesale Customers
This project was created by me and two other students for our Data Science I course at the University of Houston in Spring 2023. 

We used clustering analysis to gain a better understanding of our customer dataset: 
- K means clustering
- DBSCAN clustering
- Agglomerative clustering

# Data
Annual spending of wholesale clients in 6 product categories: 
- Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents, Delicassen

# Findings
We found two main clusters. 
### Cluster 1 
- mostly Hotel-Restaurant-Cafe (HORECA) customers
- spends more on Fresh, Frozen, Delicassen
### Cluster 2
- mostly Retail customers
- spends more on Detergents, Milk, Grocery
